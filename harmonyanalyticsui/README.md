# Harmony Analytics UI
Harmony Analytics is a react based web application.

To run the application in a local environment, do the following:
```
clone this repository
go to the repository folder -> harmonyanalyticsui
modify src -> config.js and setup AWS API Gateway URL and other settings as needed
Run the command "npm install"
Run the command "npm start"
````

Your browser should open a new window for http://localhost:3000

Note that the application will work only if the backend application, database, and data sync jobs are setup.
